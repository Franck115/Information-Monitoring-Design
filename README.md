Combining Blinded covariate adjustment with information monitoring design

We aimed to implement the method of using information monitoring design using covariate adjustment in a blinded way and make a comparison of all the methods. Simulation and real-world data was used in order to assess the performance of the proposed method and make comparison to the different methods. 

The simulation study was performed using the data set from the Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Clinical Trials Group Study 175 (ACTG175) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8813038/).

the data analysis was performed using the data set from the randomised trial of Acupuncture for Chronic Headache (https://www.causeweb.org/tshs/acupuncture/)
